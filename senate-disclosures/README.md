My idea for a report on Senate finance disclosures is to look at the Earned and Non-investment Income amounts disclosed by female versus male senators who used electronic disclosure forms in the past year. Since the senate financial disclosures database does not contain information on gender, this will require taking data from both the financial disclosures database, and the Center for American Women and Politics page on Women in the U.S. Senate 2017. I will take data on earnings reported by both senate members and their spouses.  A visualization idea is to graph comparisons of senator versus spouse income with respect to gender, and to graph median and/or mean income with respect to gender and political party.  I think this would be an interesting application of web-scraping because I found it challenging to find current data on whether gender pay gaps exist specifically among senators.  There is also debate around whether the gender pay gap exists at all, so I thought that, while my project obviously won’t definitively answer that question, it will be interesting data to show.

Relevant Quote:
“Did you know that in 2016, women working full time in the United States typically were paid just 80 percent of what men were paid, a gap of 20 percent? The gap has narrowed since the 1970s, due largely to women’s progress in education and workforce participation and to men’s wages rising at a slower rate. Still, the pay gap does not appear likely to go away on its own. At the rate of change between 1960 and 2016, women are expected to reach pay equity with men in 2059. But even that slow progress has stalled in recent years. If change continues at the slower rate seen since 2001, women will not reach pay equity with men until 2119.”
